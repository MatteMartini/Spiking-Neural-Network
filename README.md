# Spiking-Neural-Network
This Rust library can create and resolve spiking neural networks defined for any possible applicable model, thanks to the powerful extensibility achieved through Rust's type system: simply implement the Model trait for your personally defined custom model and be good to go!

By default, the Leaky Integrate and Fire model is provided in the lif submodule.
